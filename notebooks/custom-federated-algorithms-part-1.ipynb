    "This tutorial is the first part of a two-part series that demonstrates how to implement custom types of federated algorithms in TensorFlow Federated (TFF) using the Federated Core (FC) - a set of lower-level interfaces that serve as a foundation upon which we have implemented the Federated Learning (FL) layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first part is more conceptual; we introduce some of the key concepts and programming abstractions used in TFF, and we demonstrate their use on a very simple example with a distributed array of temperature sensors. In the second part of this series, we use the mechanisms we introduce here to implement a simple version of federated training and evaluation algorithms. As a follow-up, we encourage you to study the implementation of federated averaging in tff.learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this series, you should be able to recognize that the applications of Federated Core are not necessarily limited to learning. The programming abstractions we offer are quite generic, and could be used, e.g., to implement analytics and other custom types of computations over distributed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this tutorial is designed to be self-contained, we encourage you to first read tutorials on image classification and text generation for a higher-level and more gentle introduction to the TensorFlow Federated framework and the Federated Learning APIs (tff.learning), as it will help you put the concepts we describe here in context.\n",
    "Intended Uses\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, Federated Core (FC) is a development environment that makes it possible to compactly express program logic that combines TensorFlow code with distributed communication operators, such as those that are used in Federated Averaging - computing distributed sums, averages, and other types of distributed aggregations over a set of client devices in the system, broadcasting models and parameters to those devices, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be aware of [`tf.contrib.distribute`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/distribute), and a natural question to ask at this point may be: in what ways does this framework differ? Both frameworks attempt at making TensorFlow computations distributed, after all.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think about it is that, whereas the stated goal of tf.contrib.distribute is to allow users to use existing models and training code with minimal changes to enable distributed training, and much focus is on how to take advantage of distributed infrastructure to make existing training code more efficient, the goal of TFF's Federated Core is to give researchers and practitioners explicit control over the specific patterns of distributed communication they will use in their systems. The focus in FC is on providing a flexible and extensible language for expressing distributed data flow algorithms, rather than a concrete set of implemented distributed training capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary target audiences for TFF's FC API is researchers and practitioners who might want to experiment with new federated learning algorithms and evaluate the consequences of subtle design choices that affect the manner in which the flow of data in the distributed system is orchestrated, yet without getting bogged down by system implementation details. The level of abstraction that FC API is aiming for roughly corresponds to pseudocode one could use to describe the mechanics of a federated learning algorithm in a research publication - what data exists in the system and how it is transformed, but without dropping to the level of individual point-to-point network message exchanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "TFF as a whole is targeting scenarios in which data is distributed, and must remain such, e.g., for privacy reasons, and where collecting all data at a centralized location may not be a viable option. This has implication on the implementation of machine learning algorithms that require an increased degree of explicit control, as compared to scenarios in which all data can be accumulated in a centralized location at a data center."

    "# Placements\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the preceding section, we've introduced the concept of placements - groups of system participants that might be jointly hosting a federated value, and we've demonstrated the use of `tff.CLIENTS` as an example specification of a placement.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain why the notion of a placement is so fundamental that we needed to incorporate it into the TFF type system, recall what we mentioned at the beginning of this tutorial about some of the intended uses of TFF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although in this tutorial, you will only see TFF code being executed locally in a simulated environment, our goal is for TFF to enable writing code that you could deploy for execution on groups of physical devices in a distributed system, potentially including mobile or embedded devices. Each of of those devices would receive a separate set of instructions to execute locally, depending on the role it plays in the system (an end-user device, a centralized coordinator, an intermediate layer in a multi-tier architecture, etc.). It is important to be able to reason about which subsets of devices execute what code, and where different portions of the data might physically materialize.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially important when dealing with, e.g., application data on mobile devices. Since the data is private and can be sensitive, we need the ability to statically verify that this data will never leave the device (and prove facts about how the data is being processed). The placement specifications are one of the mechanisms designed to support this.\n",
    "\n",
    "TFF has been designed as a *data-centric* programming environment, and as such, unlike some of the existing frameworks that focus on operations and where those operations might run, TFF focuses on data, where that data materializes, and how it's being transformed. Consequently, placement is modeled as a property of *data* in TFF, rather than as a property of operations on data. Indeed, as you're about to see in the next section, some of the TFF operations span across locations, and run \"in the network\", so to speak, rather than being executed by a single machine or a group of machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Representing the type of a certain value as `T@G` or `{T}@G` (as opposed to just `T`) makes data placement decisions explicit, and together with a static analysis of programs written in TFF, it can serve as a foundation for providing formal privacy guarantees for sensitive on-device data.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important thing to note at this point, however, is that while we encourage TFF users to be explicit about groups of participating devices that host the data (the placements), the programmer will never deal with the raw data or identities of the individual participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the body of TFF code, by design, there's no way to enumerate the devices that constitute the group represented by `tff.CLIENTS`, or to probe for the existence of a specific device in the group. There's no concept of a device or client identity anywhere in the Federated Core API, the underlying set of architectural abstractions, or the core runtime infrastructure we provide to support simulations. All the computation logic you write will be expressed as operations on the entire client group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall here what we mentioned earlier about values of federated types being unlike Python dict, in that one cannot simply enumerate their member constituents. Think of values that your TFF program logic manipulates as being associated with placements (groups), rather than with individual participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Placements are designed to be a first-class citizen in TFF as well, and can appear as parameters and results of a placement type (to be represented by tff.PlacementType in the API). In the future, we plan to provide a variety of operators to transform or combine placements, but this is outside the scope of this tutorial. For now, it suffices to think of placement as an opaque primitive built-in type in TFF, similar to how int and bool are opaque built-in types in Python, with `tff.CLIENTS` being a constant literal of this type, not unlike `1` being a constant literal of type `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifying Placements\n",
    "\n",
    "TFF provides two basic placement literals, `tff.CLIENTS` and `tff.SERVER`, to make it easy to express the rich variety of practical scenarios that are naturally modeled as client-server architectures, with multiple client devices (mobile phones, embedded devices, distributed databases, sensors, etc.) orchestrated by a single centralized server coordinator. TFF is designed to also support custom placements, multiple client groups, multi-tiered and other, more general distributed architectures, but discussing them is outside the scope of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "TFF doesn't prescribe what either the `tff.CLIENTS` or the `tff.SERVER` actually represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `tff.SERVER` might be a single physical device.\n",
    "* `tff.SERVER` might be a group of replicas in a fault-tolerant cluster running state machine replication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather, we use the `all_equal=True` mentioned in the preceding section to express the fact that we're generally dealing with only a single item of data at the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, `tff.CLIENTS` in some applications might represent all clients in the system - what in the context of federated learning we sometimes refer to as the population, but e.g., in production implementations of Federated Averaging, it may represent a cohort - a subset of the clients selected for paticipation in a particular round of training. The abstractly defined placements are given concrete meaning when a computation in which they appear is deployed for execution (or simply invoked like a Python function in a simulated environment, as is demonstrated in this tutorial). In our local simulations, the group of clients is determined by the federated data supplied as input."

The server is just one type of participant in a federated computation. In thinking about the mechanics of such computations, it's best to always default to the global network-wide perspective, rather than the perspective of a single centralized coordinator."

    "You can think of Python code that defines a federated computation similarly to how you would think of Python code that builds a TensorFlow graph in a non-eager context (if you're not familiar with the non-eager uses of TensorFlow, think of your Python code defining a graph of operations to be executed later, but not actually running them on the fly). The non-eager graph-building code in TensorFlow is Python, but the TensorFlow graph constructed by this code is platform-independent and serializable.\n",

Python code contained in a TFF computation's body is executed at definition time, when the body of the Python function decorated with tff.federated_computation is traced before getting serialized. It's not retraced again at invocation time (except when the function is polymorphic; please refer to the documentation pages for details).\n",

    "\n",
    "Another reason is that TFF computations express the global behavior of distributed systems, as opposed to Python programs which express the local behavior of individual participants. You can see that in the simple example above, with the special operator tff.federated_mean that accepts data on client devices, but deposits the results on the server.\n",

    "The operator tff.federated_mean cannot be easily modeled as an ordinary operator in Python, since it doesn't execute locally - as noted earlier, it represents a distributed system that coordinates the behavior of multiple system participants. We will refer to such operators as federated operators, to distinguish them from ordinary (local) operators in Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "As noted above, federated computations and their constituents are best understood as models of distributed systems, and you can think of composing federated computations as composing more complex distributed systems from simpler ones. You can think of the tff.federated_mean operator as a kind of built-in template federated computation with a type signature ({T}@CLIENTS -> T@SERVER) (indeed, just like computations you write, this operator also has a complex structure - under the hood we break it down into simpler operators).\n",
    "\n",
    "The same is true of composing federated computations. The computation get_average_temperature may be invoked in a body of another Python function decorated with tff.federated_computation - doing so will cause it to be embedded in the body of the parent, much in the same way tff.federated_mean was embedded in its own body earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important restriction to be aware of is that bodies of Python functions decorated with tff.federated_computation must consist only of federated operators, i.e., they cannot directly contain TensorFlow operations. For example, you cannot directly use tf.nest interfaces to add a pair of federated values. TensorFlow code must be confined to blocks of code decorated with a tff.tf_computation discussed in the following section. Only when wrapped in this manner can the wrapped TensorFlow code be invoked in the body of a tff.federated_computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasons for this separation are technical (it's hard to trick operators such as tf.add to work with non-tensors) as well as architectural. The language of federated computations (i.e., the logic constructed from serialized bodies of Python functions decorated with tff.federated_computation) is designed to serve as a platform-independent glue language. This glue language is currently used to build distributed systems from embedded sections of TensorFlow code (confined to tff.tf_computation blocks). In the fullness of time, we anticipate the need to embed sections of other, non-TensorFlow logic, such as relational database queries that might represent input pipelines, all connected together using the same glue language (the tff.federated_computation blocks).\n"
